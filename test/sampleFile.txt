File Operations
os.Create(): The os.Create() method is used to create a file with the desired name. If a file with the same name already exists, the Create function truncates the file.
os.ReadFile(): The os.ReadFile() method takes the path to the file to be read as its only parameter. This method returns either the data of the file or an error.os.WriteFile(): The os.WriteFile() method is used to write data to a file. The WriteFile() method takes three parameters: the first is the location of the file we wish to write to, the second is the data object, and the third is the FileMode, which represents the fileâ€™s mode and permission bits.
